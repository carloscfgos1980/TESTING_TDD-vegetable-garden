# master-TDD-vegetable-garden

1.  Create a repository just with README.md
2.  clone this repository in the file where I will storage the project.
3.  Add packet json files with Command promp, using the tool (Git)
4.  Console.log everything to check if I" am dealing with a array, onject or HTML collection.
5.  "module.export does not work with inspect in google so it needs to be commented (//) in order to try console.log
6.  If. If-else in getYieldPlant was the most difficult one cos I had to fig out how to make the function still work even when some elements were missing.
